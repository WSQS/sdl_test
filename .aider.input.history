+title: Add null checks for gpu_wrapper->data() calls in main.cpp
+description: |-
+  ## Description
+
+  Throughout main.cpp, `gpu_wrapper->data()` is called without verifying that the GPU device pointer is valid. If `GpuWrapper` construction fails (when `SDL_CreateGPUDevice` returns `nullptr`), these calls will pass `nullptr` to SDL functions, causing undefined behavior or crashes.
+
+  ## Affected Locations
+
+  - Line 78 (SDL_ClaimWindowForGPUDevice)
+  - Line 103 (shader compilation)
+  - Line 127 (shader compilation)
+  - Line 168 (shader creation)
+  - Line 174 (shader creation)
+  - Line 180 (pipeline creation)
+  - Lines 209-210 (ImGui initialization)
+  - Lines 272-273 (shader handling)
+  - Lines 276-277 (pipeline recreation)
+  - Line 288 (command buffer acquisition)
+  - Lines 358-359 (shader release)
+  - Line 362 (pipeline release)
+
+  ## Suggested Solutions
+
+  1. Fix GpuWrapper to throw on construction failure, ensuring the device is always valid
+  2. Add validation in init() after creating gpu_wrapper
+  3. Add a null check helper for defensive programming
